These are the projects that are made in the past years and worth to post.

The program that made in VB was succesfully sold to a comapny who use the program in these days. I wrote that program when I was around 15-16 years old.

The javascript ones are Discord bots, which I made for myself and for my friend. The giveaway bot are used in these days.

The java ones are created for Minecraft plugin. One is completly unique, the second ones are use another minecraft plugins to work.
